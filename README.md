## Tools for Stock Market Analysis

- Provides free of cost Market Data Visualization Tools. Few of the features include, 
   1) Heatmap of Stocks in NSE indices that can be sorted by OHLC and True range
   2) Weightage of Stocks in NSE Indices
   3) Sentiment Analysis to make Buy or Sell decisions, etc.

- All data is Web scraped from NSE website (nseindia.com). I am using a Free CORS proxy to remove cors errors, so please be patient when using the site as the proxy fails to receive data for the most of the time. Use a NoCors Extension/Addon on your browser for better experience.
